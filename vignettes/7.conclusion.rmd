# Conclusion
Bayesian model averaging is widely accepted as a solid theoretical foundation for addressing model uncertainty; however, it involves the challenge of the elicitation of priors for all parameters of each model and the probability of each model. When prior information is unavailable or minuscule with respect to the information provided by the data, default priors can be used to characterize prior probability distributions of model parameters. Still, BMA results are sensitive to prior specification, and the selection of the appropriate default prior remains a challenge.

In this paper, the predictive performance of nine candidate default priors that have been proposed in statistics literature, were evaluated on a data set containing 645 movies, and a parameter set of 17 regressors. Mean squared error was computed for each prior on a random sampling of hold out observations and this process was repeated for 400 trials. The best models were selected based upon average MSE over the trials.  

The AIC median probability model prior decisively outperformed the other eight priors.
