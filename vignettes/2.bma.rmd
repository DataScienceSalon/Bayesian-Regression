# Theoretical Framework
## Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA)
The objective of variable selection in linear regression is to identify a set of candidate predictors that produce the "best" model. Here, "best" model may mean the model that best predicts unseen cases, or that which is best explained by the data. Given an independent variable $Y$ and a set of $k$ candidate predictors $X_1, X_2, ..., X_k$, the "best" model is more concretely described as follows: 
$$Y = \beta_0 + \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{p}\beta_jX_j + \epsilon = X\beta + \epsilon$$
where:   
$X_1, X_2, ..., X_p$  is a subset of $X_1, X_2, ..., X_k$  
$X$ is a $n \times (p + 1)$ matrix containing the observed data on $p$ predictors  
$\epsilon$ ~ $N(0,\sigma^2I)$  
$\beta$ and $\sigma^2$ are the $(p + 1)$ individual unknown parameters  

However, model selection exercises that lead to a single "best" model ignore model uncertainty [@Hodges1987; @Draper1995; @Raftery1997], and leads to underestimation of uncertainty when making inferences about quantities of interest [@Raftery1997].

Bayesian model averaging, employed when a variety of statistically reasonable models are extant, addresses model uncertainty and leads to optimal predictive ability [@Raftery1994] by average over *all* possible combinations of predictors when making inferences about quantities of interest. The final estimates are computed as a weighted average of the parameter estimates from each of the models. 

The standard BMA solution, first introduced by Leamer in 1978, defines a set of all possible models as $M = ({M_1,..., M_k})$. If $\Delta$ is the quantity of interest, such as a movie prediction or tomorrow's stock price, then the posterior distribution of $\Delta$ given the data $D$ is:
$$Pr(\Delta|D) = \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^KPr(\Delta|M_k, D)Pr(M_k|D)$$
This is an average of the posterior distributions under each model weighted by the corresponding posterior model probabilities [@Raftery1997]. The posterior model probability of $M_k$ is then computed as the ratio of its marginal likelihood to the sum of the marginal likelihoods over the entire model space and is given by[@Amini]:

$$Pr(M_k|D) = \frac{Pr(D|M_k)Pr(M_k)}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{K}Pr(D|M_i)Pr(M_i)}$$
where:  
$$Pr(D|M_k) = \int p(D|\theta_k, M_k)P(\theta_k|M_k)d\theta_k$$
is the marginal likelihood of model $M_k$, $\theta_k$ is the vector of parameters of model $M_k$, $Pr(\theta_k|M_k)$ is the prior density of $\theta_k$ under model $M_k$, $Pr(D|\theta_k, M_k)$ is the likelihood of the data given the $M_k$ and $\theta_k$, and $Pr(M_k)$ is the prior probability that $M_k$ is the true model.

At this stage, the *posterior inclusion probability* of each candidate predictor $\beta_p$, $Pr(\beta_p\neq0|D)$, is obtained by summing the posterior model probabilities over all models that include $\beta_p$. Referring back to the linear regression model; the posterior means and standard deviations of coefficient vectors $\beta$, are defined as:
$$E[\hat{\beta}|D] = \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{2^k}\hat{\beta}Pr(M_j)|D),$$
$$V[\hat{\beta}|D] = \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{2^k}Var[{\beta|D,M_j] +\hat\beta^2})Pr(M_j|D) - E[\beta|D]^2.$$
Averaging over *all* models in this way provides better predictive results, as measured by the logarithmic scoring rule, than any single model $M_j$ $(j  1,...,K)$ [@Raftery1997]. 

## Prior Distributions of Parameters
To implement BMA, one must specify *prior distributions* over all parameters in all models, as well as prior probabilities of the models themselves. If prior information about the parameters and the models is available, it should be used. However, if the amount of prior information is small relative to the effort required to specify it, as is often the case, default or so-called "non-informative" or "reference" priors may be used for such analysis. The selection of default priors may effect the *integrated likelihood*, the key factor in computing posterior model weights, and so the prior density should be wide enough and reasonably flat over the region of the parameter space where the likelihood is large, but not so spread out as to decrease the prior at the posterior mode.  This decreases the integrated likelihood and may unnecessarily penalize larger models [@Raftery1994]. 

This experiment explores the following nine default priors supported in literature (`r kfigr::figr(label = "priors", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Table")`). 

`r kfigr::figr(label = "priors", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Table")`: Parameter priors

```

The **Bayesian Information Criterior (BIC) prior** is a reference prior based upon an approximation of the log marginal likelihood of parameter value $\theta$ using the Bayesian information criterion.  
$$log Pr(\theta|M_k) \approx c - 1/2BIC_k$$
where:   
$$BIC_k = nlog(1-R^2_k) + p_klog(n)$$    
The $R^2$ and $p_k$ variables are the coefficient of determination and the number of regressors for model $M_k$, respectively, $n$ is the number of observations, and $c$ is a constant that does not vary across models and so cancels in the model averaging. This prior is typically flat where the likelihood is large and contains the same amount of information that would be contained in a typical single observation [@Wasserman1996]. The **Akaike information criterion (AIC) prior** is the same as the BIC prior above, except AIC is used to approximate the likelihood of the data given a model $M_k$. The remaining priors are based upon the multivariate normal-gamma conjugate prior where the conditional distribution $X|\theta \sim N(\mu,1/\lambda\sigma^2)$ and $\beta \sigma^2\sim N(\beta_0, g\sigma^2S^{-1}_{XX})$, where the scaled variance and covariances are obtained from the ordinary least squares (OLS). This reduces prior elicitation down to two components, the prior mean of $\beta_0$, taken to be 0, and the scalar g. **Empirical Bayes Global Prior(EP-G)** uses an EM algorithm to find a common or global estimate of g, averaged over all models [@Clyde2017]. **Empirical Bayes Local Prior(EP-L)** uses the MLE of g from the marginal likelihood within each model [@Clyde2017]. The **Zellner's g-prior**  is a multivariate normal-gamma conjugate prior where $\beta \sigma^2\sim N(\beta_0, g\sigma^2S^{-1}_{XX})$, $g = n$, and the scaled variance and covariances are obtained from the ordinary least squares (OLS).**Hyper-g** is a class of g-priors based upon continuous proper hyperprior f(g), giving a mixture of g-priors where the prior on g/(1+g) is a Beta(1, alpha/2) [@Clyde2017]. **Hyper-g-n** is a special case of the Hyper-g prior where  u = g/n and u ~ Beta(1, alpha/2), to provide consistency when the null model is true [@Clyde2017]. **Hyper-g Laplace** is the same as the Hyper-g prior, but uses Laplace approximation to integrate over the prior on g. Lastly, the **Zellner-Siow prior** places a gamma prior on n/g with G(shape = 1/2, scale = 1/2).


## Model Priors
For this experiment, the uniform distribution that assigns equal prior probability to all models was used such that $Pr(M_k) = 1 / K$ for each $k$ [@Raftery1988].
