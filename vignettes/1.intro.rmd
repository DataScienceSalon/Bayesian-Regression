# Introduction
Bayesian model averaging (BMA), now widely accepted as a principled way of accounting for model uncertainty, involves the challenge of the elicitation of priors for all parameters of each model and the probability of each model. It is this elicitation of prior knowledge about the parameters of interest which often leads to more reliable estimates and smaller uncertainties. In some cases, the elicitation of prior knowledge is essential to obtaining meaningful results. If substantial prior information is available in the form of a probability distributions, it should be used. In many cases; however, prior information may be unavailable or miniscule with respect to the information provided by the data. In such cases, default priors can be used to characterize prior probability distributions of model parameters. Still, inappropriate priors may unduly influence posterior-based inferences and decision making. 

>This paper examines the effect of default priors on Bayesian regression model selection, model size, posterior inclusion probabilities of regressors, and on predictive performance. 

These issues are illustrated in the context of a linear regression model to predict audience scores for movies, given 645 observations and 16 regression parameters. Nine candidate default parameter priors were evaluated.  BMA reference models, which best describe knowledge about future observations, served as proxies for the "true" data generating models. Candidate models were evaluated vis-a-vis the BMA reference models on the basis of predictive performance.   

## Background
The effect of default priors on BMA, model selection, and predictive performance have been studied in range of disciplines including, econometrics, social sciences, biostatistics. Eicher, Papageorgiou, and Raftery [@Eicher2011] evaluated 12 priors which have been proposed in statistics and economics literature and found that the Unit Information Prior (UIP), which corresponds to the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) approximation of the marginal likelihood, combined with the uniform prior over the model space, outperformed, the 11 other priors. Fernandez *et al.* [@FernahNdez2001] evaluated nine priors based upon Zellner's g-prior structure [@ZELLNER1985187] and recommended a g-prior equal to $1/k^2$ when $n\leq k^2$ and $1/n$ when $n > k^2$, where $n$ is the number of observations and $k$ is the number of regressors. Gelman, *et al.*, [@Gelman2008] proposed the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, for logistic and other regression models. 

The papers is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes BMA key concepts, with a focus on prior parameter specification. Section 3 introduces the motivating example and the data used for this experiment. Section 4 includes a univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis (EDA). Section 5 covers model prior comparison, evaluation and selection. Section 6 reports the prediction accuracy of top performing models on unseen data. Finally, section 6 includes concluding remarks. 

BMA modeling and prediction functionality was provided by the BAS package [@Clyde2017]. Core scripts and functions used in this study are included in the appendix.
